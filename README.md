# SciQuel-Sample
Title: SciQuel Coding Sample\
Description: A website made to look like the 'Website Example.png'
that is located in '/static/images/Website Example.png' using
only using standard HTML and CSS.

NOTES:\
    1. The ellpises in the article previews for the sub articles are only one line
       because the standard CSS ellipsis tag doesn't allow for text to wrap.\
    2. The images used for the articles are resized screenshots from Website Example.png.\
    3. Fonts used are all 'Arial' since I do not know what the fonts are being used in the screenshot.\
    4. 'Read all recent' links to nowhere.\
    5. Colors were obtained using an online color picker to get colors from 'Website Example.png.'\
    6. All classes in 'style.css' have comments saying what they are used for.
